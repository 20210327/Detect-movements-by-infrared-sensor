# Detect-movements-by-infrared-sensor
In this project, we use microcontroller AT89S52, infrared sensor HC-SR 501 and other electronic components to simulation a circuit that can detect movements. When you run Proteus project, An annoucement "KHONG PHAT HIEN" will be displayed on the LCD screen. Once you change the logic gate on sensor, the annoucement "PHAT HIEN" will be displayed, it looks like when a movement presents in front of the sensor. This project can be applied in real life such as security system, automatic lights system, etc.
